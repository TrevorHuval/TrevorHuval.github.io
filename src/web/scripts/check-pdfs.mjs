 * The site's content files are linted for this already, but a PDF is a binary

 * that arrives with a contact block at the top. One did: a version carrying a
 * personal email and phone number reached a public repository, and taking it
 * out meant rewriting published history.
 *
 * Text in a PDF is usually inside a Flate-compressed stream, so scanning the
 * raw bytes proves almost nothing. This inflates every stream first, then scans
 * the decompressed text along with the raw file and its metadata.
